## Gym Website Design

To view the website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. All of the necessary CSS and JavaScript files are included in the project folder.

* Services section with details about the gym's classes and programs
* Membership section with pricing and membership options
* Contact section with a contact form and map of the gym's location
